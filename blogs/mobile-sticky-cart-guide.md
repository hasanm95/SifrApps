We live in a mobile-first world. 79% of smartphone users have made a purchase on their device in the last 6 months. However, mobile conversion rates (2.1%) are still significantly lower than desktop (3.5%). Why? **Friction.**

On a desktop, the "Add to Cart" button is usually always visible. On a mobile phone, as the user scrolls down to read reviews or descriptions, the button disappears. If they decide to buy, they have to scroll all the way back up. That split-second of effort is enough to cause a "micro-abandonment."

### The "Thumb Zone" Science

UX researchers map the phone screen into zones based on how easily a user can reach them with one hand.

- **The Safe Zone:** The bottom center of the screen (Easy to reach).
- **The Danger Zone:** The top corners (Hard to reach).

Most Shopify themes put the cart button at the top (Danger Zone). A **Sticky Add-to-Cart Bar** fixes this by anchoring the button to the bottom of the screen (**The Safe Zone**). It is always accessible, always visible, and right under the user's thumb.

### Results You Can Expect

1. **Reduced Friction:** No scrolling required to buy.
2. **Higher CTR:** Stickiness increases the visibility of your Call to Action (CTA).
3. **Better Data:** FOMO Gen's sticky cart includes analytics, so you can see exactly how many clicks are coming from the sticky bar vs. the main button.

### Action Plan

Don't let mobile visitors bounce because they can't find the button. Install a sticky cart today. It is a "set and forget" optimization that pays dividends immediately.
