Free shipping is the #1 incentive for online shoppers. In fact, 75% of consumers expect free shipping on orders under $50. But if you offer free shipping on everything, you will go bankrupt. The secret is setting a **Free Shipping Threshold** that forces customers to add "one more thing" to their cart, boosting your Average Order Value (AOV).

### The Math: How to Find Your Magic Number

You shouldn't guess. You need to calculate a threshold that covers your shipping cost while feeling attainable to the customer.

**The Formula:**
`Threshold = (Average Shipping Cost / Gross Profit Margin) + Average Order Value`

**Example:**

- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $40
- **Average Shipping Cost:** $8
- **Gross Profit Margin:** 40% (0.40)

**Calculation:**

1. Divide Shipping Cost by Margin: $8 / 0.40 = $20.
2. Add to AOV: $20 + $40 = $60.

Your Threshold should be **$60**. If you set it at $60, the extra profit from the upsell covers the shipping cost completely.

### Gamifying the Experience

Once you have your number (e.g., $60), you need to tell the customer. Don't just hide it in a policy page. Use a **Progressive Free Shipping Bar**.

- **Step 1:** Customer adds a $40 item.
- **Bar Updates:** _"You are only $20 away from Free Shipping!"_
- **Psychology:** This triggers the **"Goal Gradient Effect."** People speed up their behavior as they get closer to a goal.
