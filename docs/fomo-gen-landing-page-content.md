Prompt: A split-screen comparison. Left side: A sad, empty Shopify store with a "0 Sales" graph. Right side: A vibrant store with "Someone in New York just bought..." popup, a "Only 3 Left" stock counter, and a graph showing sales spiking up. High contrast, professional 3D vector style.

Alt Tag: Shopify store conversion rate optimization before and after using FOMO Gen social proof app.

Headline: Is "App Bloat" Killing Your Store’s Speed? Body: You know you need social proof to sell. But installing one app for Sales Pops, another for Countdown Timers, and a third for Sticky Carts destroys your site speed.

Fact: A 1-second delay in page load can drop conversions by up to 17%.

The Struggle: Most "all-in-one" apps are expensive, complex, and slow down your theme.

The Solution: FOMO Gen gives you the essential 5 conversion tools in a single, speed-optimized script.

1. Social Proof Notifications

Headline: Show Them You’re Busy.

Body: Display recent purchases to build instant trust. 92% of consumers hesitate to buy without social proof. Eliminate that doubt.

2. Scarcity & Urgency

Body: Use Low Stock Countdowns ("Only 2 left!") and Timer Bars to push customers from "browsing" to "buying" right now.
