Google has made it clear: **Page Speed is a ranking factor**. Yet, many Shopify merchants continue to install heavy apps that inject massive JavaScript files, killing their Core Web Vitals.

### The "App Bloat" Problem

A typical dropshipping store might have an app for Sales Popups, another for Sticky Cart, and a third for Trust Badges. Each app makes separate server requests. Research shows that for every second your site loads faster, conversion rates improve by 17%.

### The Solution: Consolidation

The trend for 2026 is **Consolidation**. Instead of 5 separate apps, use a single, optimized solution like **FOMO Gen**. It provides the social proof, the sticky cart, and the badges in one script load. This reduces HTTP requests and keeps your Lighthouse score green.
