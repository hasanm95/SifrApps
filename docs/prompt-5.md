1. The Audit: What's Missing?
   The Pivot: The site is currently in Dark Mode (Engineering/Elite). You mentioned moving to Light Mode (Academic/Trust)—we need to update the CSS/Prompt for this.

Deep Links: Your "Solutions" and "Apps" are sections (anchors), not pages. Google cannot rank an anchor as effectively as a dedicated URL.

Compare Page: The "Comparison Guides" link in your footer goes nowhere (#). This is a high-traffic priority.

Blog/Logic Lab: There is no archive or article structure yet.

2. The Final Site Map (Structure)
   You need to create these physical pages to capture search traffic:

sifrapps.com/ (The Homepage - Your current page, converted to Light Mode)

sifrapps.com/apps/fomogen (Dedicated Product Page)

sifrapps.com/apps/mindful-guard (Dedicated Product Page)

sifrapps.com/solutions/ecommerce-conversion (Problem-solver Page)

sifrapps.com/compare/fomogen-vs-nudgify (Comparison Page)

sifrapps.com/blog/ (The Content Hub)

3. Prompt for the Light Mode Conversion (Homepage)
   Use this prompt in your builder to switch the vibe and fix the navigation links.

Prompt:

"Convert the current SifrApps site to a Light Mode 'Academic Logic' aesthetic. Visual Changes:

Background: Pure White (#FFFFFF) with a very subtle light-grey dot grid pattern.

Text: Slate Black (#111827) for high legibility.

Accents: Deepen the Emerald Green to #059669.

Borders: Thin #E5E7EB lines.

Structural Changes:

Change the Navbar links from anchors (#) to actual paths:

Expertise -> /solutions

Ecosystem -> /apps

Methodology -> /about

Change the Footer links:

Comparison Guides -> /compare

Documentation -> /blog

Content Update: Change 'Invasive Inclusion' to 'Radical Accessibility' for better branding."

4. Prompt for the "Apps" Portfolio Page (/apps)
   This page is for people searching for "SifrApps Portfolio" or "Shopify apps by Sifr."

Prompt:

"Create a new page for SifrApps.com at /apps. Layout: A clean header titled 'Our Ecosystem.' Content: Use a two-column grid.

Card 1 (FomoGen): Title, screenshot placeholder, 'Social Proof for Shopify,' and a button 'View Product Details.'

Card 2 (Mindful Guard): Title, screenshot placeholder, 'Logical Guardrails for Android,' and a button 'View Product Details.' Footer: Maintain the site-wide Light Mode footer."

5. Prompt for the "Comparison" Page (/compare)
   This is your primary tool for stealing traffic from competitors.

Prompt:

"Create a page at /compare. Content: Create a comparison table for Mindful Guard vs. Forest vs. StayFocused.

Use the 'SifrApps wins' logic: Highlight our Privacy (100% Local), Battery (Sub-5MB), and Accessibility (WCAG 2.1).

Style the table with thin grey borders and use the Emerald Green for 'Yes' checkmarks.

Add a CTA at the bottom: 'Experience Logical Superiority. Download Mindful Guard.'"

Entrepreneur's Checklist for this week:
Check URLs: Ensure your menu doesn't use # anymore. Every click should feel like a new page loading (even if it's fast).

Google Search Console: Once you have these 5+ pages, submit your Sitemap.

The "Invasive" Fix: Make sure you change that word on the homepage—it's the only part of your copy that feels "unfriendly."
