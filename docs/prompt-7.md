The Master Prompt: FomoGen Product Landing Page
Project: FomoGen (Product Page for applass.com/fomogen) Persona: Act as a Senior Product Designer and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) expert. Theme: "Academic Logic" – A Light Mode aesthetic that feels like Stripe, linear, and high-end engineering.

1. Design & Visual Guidelines
   Vibe: Clean, airy, and trustworthy. Use a white-space-heavy design with a "mathematical grid" (subtle 20px dot grid) background.

Color Palette:

Background: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

Typography: #111827 (Slate Black) for readability.

Primary Accent: #059669 (Algorithm Emerald) for CTAs and "Success" indicators.

Borders: #E5E7EB (Thin, light grey).

Visual Elements: Use "Performance Blueprints" (SVG line art) instead of generic stock photos. Show code snippets or payload size visualizations to emphasize the technical "Moat."
