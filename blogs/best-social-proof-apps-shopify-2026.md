If you run a Shopify store, you know the pain: You have traffic, but they aren't buying. The missing ingredient is usually **Social Proof**. In fact, 92% of consumers hesitate to purchase when there is no evidence of previous buying activity. But with hundreds of apps in the Shopify App Store, which one actually works without slowing down your site?

### 1. FOMO Gen (Best for Speed & Value)

If you are tired of "app bloat," FOMO Gen is the modern solution. Unlike competitors that force you to pay for separate features, FOMO Gen consolidates Sales Pops, Stock Countdowns, Sticky Carts, and Free Shipping Bars into one lightweight tool.

**Why it wins:** It’s built for Core Web Vitals. It doesn't drag down your Lighthouse score.

**Cost:** Generous Free Plan available.

### 2. Fomo (The Enterprise Choice)

The app that started it all. Fomo is powerful and integrates with 100+ tools like Klaviyo and Mailchimp. However, it can be pricey for new stores and may be "overkill" if you just need simple notifications.

### 3. Nudgify (The UX Choice)

Nudgify uses "Nudges" to guide customer behavior. It is great for design, but pricing tiers can scale up quickly based on your view count.

### 4. Vitals (The Heavyweight)

Vitals packs 40+ apps into one. It’s comprehensive, but having 40 features running scripts can sometimes overwhelm your dashboard and impact load times on older themes.

### Conclusion

For maximum features with minimal impact on site speed, **FOMO Gen** is the top recommendation for 2026.
