Free shipping is no longer a perk; it's an expectation. However, if you offer it on every order, you eat into your margins. The secret is to set a **"Free Shipping Threshold"** just above your Average Order Value (AOV).

### The Magic Number

If your AOV is $40, set free shipping at $50.

**Why?** 58% of consumers will add items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping.

**Result:** This strategy typically leads to a 30% increase in average order value.

### Gamifying the Experience

Don't just hide the policy in the footer. Use a **Progressive Free Shipping Bar** (available in FOMO Gen).

1. **Stage 1:** "Free shipping on orders over $50."
2. **Stage 2 (Cart at $30):** "You are only $20 away from Free Shipping!"
3. **Stage 3 (Goal Met):** "Congrats! You've unlocked Free Shipping."
