Role: Act as a world-class UI/UX Designer and Frontend Engineer.

Project Name: AppLass (AppLass.com) Brand Identity: A "Logic-First" Software Studio founded by a mathematician and full-stack developer with 7 years of experience. The vibe is "Stripe-meets-Apple"—minimalist, high-performance, and elite.

Layout & Structure:

Hero Section: High-contrast, clean typography. Headline: "Logic-Driven Apps for the Modern Web." Sub-headline: "From Shopify conversion tools to mindful mobile experiences, we build software where mathematical precision meets human-centric design." Include a primary CTA: "Explore Our Apps."

The "Founder's Moat" Section: A subtle block highlighting the "AppLass" philosophy: 7 years of full-stack expertise, a foundation in Mathematics, and a "WCAG 2.1 First" approach to accessibility.

Product Bento Grid:

App 1 (FomoGen): A Shopify app focused on social proof and conversion. Highlight: "Lightweight, High-Conversion, Zero Bloat."

App 2 (Mindful Guard): An Android app for digital focus. Highlight: "Reclaim your time with logical guardrails."

SEO-Focused Solutions Section: A three-column grid for "Problem-Solution" landing pages:

"E-commerce Growth"

"Digital Productivity"

"Web Accessibility Consulting"

Technical Footer: Minimalist. Include links for "Solutions," "Comparison Guides," and "Support."

Visual Style & Design System:

Color Palette: Deep Space Black (#0A0A0A), Pure White (#FFFFFF), and a single accent color: "Algorithm Emerald" (#00FF41) or "Logic Blue" (#2563EB).

Typography: Sans-serif, high-legibility (Inter or SF Pro).

Accessibility: Use high-contrast ratios. Every interactive element must have a clear focus state. The site must be navigable by keyboard.

Performance: Use optimized SVG icons only. No heavy imagery. The site should feel "instant."

SEO Specifics:

Structure the site using semantic HTML5 tags (header, main, section, article).

Add placeholders for <script type="application/ld+json"> for SoftwareApplication schema.

Ensure all images have descriptive Alt Text placeholders.

Why this prompt works for your goal:
It uses your "Math Graduate" status: This builds immediate E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) for Google’s Search Generative Experience.

It emphasizes Accessibility: In 2026, accessibility isn't just a "nice to have"—Google uses it as a ranking signal.

Product-Led SEO: By asking for a "Solutions Section" and "Bento Grid," you are creating the structure needed to rank for "Problem" keywords.

Pro-Tip for Antigravity:
Once the site is generated, go into the "SEO Settings" of the tool and ensure your Meta Titles follow this pattern:

Home: AppLass | Logic-Driven Software Studio
