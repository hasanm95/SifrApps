Over 79% of smartphone users have made a purchase on their mobile device in the last six months. But on a small screen, scrolling down a long product page often means the "Buy" button disappears.

### The "Thumb Zone" Issue

If a user decides to buy after reading reviews at the bottom of the page, they have to scroll all the way back up. That split-second of friction is where you lose them.

### The Fix: Sticky Add-to-Cart

A **Sticky Add-to-Cart bar** stays fixed to the bottom of the mobile screen. It ensures the purchase decision is always one tap away.

**Stat:** Simplifying the path to cart on mobile can increase conversions by significant margins.

### Why Pay for It?

Most sticky cart apps cost $5-$10/month. **FOMO Gen** includes a customizable, mobile-responsive sticky cart for free, along with its social proof features. It’s the easiest UX upgrade you can make today.
