If you run a Shopify store, you are fighting a battle for trust. Research shows that 92% of consumers hesitate to make a purchase if there are no visible reviews or social proof on the page. You need an app to bridge that gap.

But here is the problem: The Shopify App Store is flooded with "Sales Pop" apps. Some are expensive enterprise tools; others are poorly coded scripts that drag down your Core Web Vitals.

In this guide, we tested the top 5 social proof apps for 2026 to help you find the one that balances features, price, and site speed.

### 1. FOMO Gen (Best Overall Value & Speed)

**The "All-in-One" Speed Champion**
Most merchants make the mistake of installing one app for Sales Pops, another for Trust Badges, and a third for Sticky Carts. This causes "App Bloat," slowing down your mobile load times.

FOMO Gen was built to solve this. It consolidates the essential conversion features—Social Proof, Stock Scarcity, Sticky Cart, and Free Shipping Bars—into a single, lightweight app embed block.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-Time Sales Pops:** Show recent orders to build trust.
- **Inventory Scarcity:** "Only 3 Left" counters to trigger FOMO.
- **Mobile Sticky Cart:** Keep the buy button visible in the "Thumb Zone."
- **Progressive Shipping Bar:** Gamify your checkout to boost Average Order Value (AOV).

**Pros:** Zero impact on Core Web Vitals; generous free plan; replaces 4 other apps.
**Cons:** Newer to the market (fewer reviews than legacy apps).
**Price:** Free plan available.

### 2. Fomo (The Enterprise Choice)

**The Original Social Proof Tool**
Fomo is the app that coined the term. It is a robust, enterprise-grade solution used by massive brands.

**Pros:** It integrates with over 100+ tools (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Yotpo). If you have a complex tech stack, Fomo connects to everything.
**Cons:** It can be "overkill" for small to mid-sized stores. The pricing is higher than average, and it focuses strictly on notifications rather than offering utility tools like sticky carts.
**Price:** Starts at ~$19/month.

### 3. Nudgify (The UX Choice)

**Behavioral "Nudges"**
Nudgify takes a different approach. Instead of standard popups, it uses "Nudges" based on real-time data. It’s great for creating distinct cognitive biases like "Popularity" or "Scarcity."

**Pros:** Beautiful, native-feeling UI that doesn't look "spammy."
**Cons:** Pricing is often based on "notifications shown." If you have a viral post and traffic spikes, you might hit your limit and the nudges stop working abruptly.

### 4. Vitals (The Heavyweight)

**40 Apps in One**
Vitals is a powerhouse that bundles 40+ different apps into one subscription.

**Pros:** You get everything from Wheel of Fortune popups to currency converters.
**Cons:** "Jack of all trades, master of none." having 40 features available can clutter your dashboard. Additionally, running too many active modules can negatively impact script execution time on mobile devices.

### 5. Rocket Sales Pop (The Legacy Option)

**The Old School Favorite**
One of the most installed apps in Shopify history. It’s a staple for dropshippers.

**Pros:** Massive install base and familiar design.
**Cons:** Reviews indicate that bugs can sometimes reset data, and the interface feels dated compared to modern 2026 standards.

### Conclusion

If you want enterprise integrations and have a high budget, choose Fomo. If you want a lightweight, speed-optimized tool that gives you Social Proof, Scarcity, and Cart Optimization for free, **FOMO Gen** is the smart choice for 2026.
