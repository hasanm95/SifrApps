Role: Act as a Senior CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) Designer and Tech Marketer.

Project Name: SifrApps Comparison Template URL Target: sifrapps.com/compare/[competitor-name] Design Aesthetic: High-tech, minimalist, data-driven. Use the "SifrApps" Dark Mode theme (Deep Black, Pure White, Emerald Green accents).

Page Sections & Content:

The "Choice" Hero:

Headline: "The Logical Alternative to [Competitor Name]."

Sub-headline: "Why elite developers and high-growth Shopify merchants are switching from bloated legacy tools to SifrApps' logic-first architecture."

CTA: "Make the Switch - Get Started for Free."

The Comparison Matrix (Table):

Create a 3-column table: [Feature], [Competitor Name], and [SifrApps Product].

Ensure the SifrApps column is visually highlighted with an emerald border and subtle glow.

Columns to include: Load Speed, Privacy/Data Logging, Accessibility (WCAG), Battery/Server Impact, Pricing Model.

Logic: Use green checkmarks for SifrApps and grey "X" or "Limited" icons for the competitor.

The "Technical Debt" Section:

Two-column layout.

Left side (The Competitor): "The Legacy Way" (Bloated scripts, tracking cookies, slow load times).

Right side (SifrApps): "The Sifr Way" (Clean math-based logic, zero telemetry, sub-5MB payload).

"Why it Matters" Cards:

Three cards explaining the impact:

SEO Impact: Faster load times lead to better Google rankings.

Conversion Impact: Higher accessibility means you don't exclude 20% of the population.

Integrity: Your data stays yours. Period.

Testimonial / "Switch" Story:

A quote block: "We shaved 2 seconds off our Shopify load time just by switching from [Competitor] to FomoGen. The math doesn't lie."

Final Conversion Footer:

Massive CTA button: "Experience Logical Superiority. Install Now."

Technical Requirements:

Responsiveness: The table must transform into a vertical "Comparison List" on mobile devices to maintain readability.

Semantic HTML: Use <table> tags for the matrix and H2 for section titles to help Google index the comparison.

Sticky Header: Keep the "Install" button visible as the user scrolls through the comparison.
